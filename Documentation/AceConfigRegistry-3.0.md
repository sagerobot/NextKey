# AceConfigRegistry-3.0

AceConfigRegistry-3.0 handles central registration of options tables in use by addons and modules.
Options tables can be registered as raw tables, OR as function refs that return a table.
Such functions receive three arguments: `uiType`, `uiName`, `appName`.

- Valid `uiTypes`: "cmd", "dropdown", "dialog". This is verified by the library at call time.
- The `uiName` field is expected to contain the full name of the calling addon, including version, e.g. "FooBar-1.0". This is verified by the library at call time.
- The `appName` field is the options table name as given at registration time

`:IterateOptionsTables()` (and `:GetOptionsTable()` if only given one argument) return a function reference that the requesting config handling addon must call with valid `uiType`, `uiName`.

## AceConfigRegistry:GetOptionsTable(appName, uiType, uiName)

Query the registry for a specific options table.
If only `appName` is given, a function is returned which you can call with (`uiType`,`uiName`) to get the table.
If `uiType` & `uiName` are given, the table is returned.

### Parameters

- `appName`: The application name as given to `:RegisterOptionsTable()`
- `uiType`: The type of UI to get the table for, one of "cmd", "dropdown", "dialog"
- `uiName`: The name of the library/addon querying for the table, e.g. "MyLib-1.0"

## AceConfigRegistry:IterateOptionsTables()

Returns an iterator of `["appName"]=funcref` pairs

## AceConfigRegistry:NotifyChange(appName)

Fires a "ConfigTableChange" callback for those listening in on it, allowing config GUIs to refresh.
You should call this function if your options table changed from any outside event, like a game event or a timer.

### Parameters

- `appName`: The application name as given to `:RegisterOptionsTable()`

## AceConfigRegistry:RegisterOptionsTable(appName, options, skipValidation)

Register an options table with the config registry.

### Parameters

- `appName`: The application name as given to `:RegisterOptionsTable()`
- `options`: The options table, OR a function reference that generates it on demand.
    See the top of the page for info on arguments passed to such functions.
- `skipValidation`: Skip options table validation (primarily useful for extremely huge options, with a noticeable slowdown)

## AceConfigRegistry:ValidateOptionsTable(options, name, errlvl)

Validates basic structure and integrity of an options table
Does NOT verify that get/set etc actually exist, since they can be defined at any depth

### Parameters

- `options`: The table to be validated
- `name`: The name of the table to be validated (shown in any error message)
- `errlvl`: (optional number) error level offset, default 0 (=errors point to the function calling `:ValidateOptionsTable`)
