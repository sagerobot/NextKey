# AceComm-3.0

AceComm-3.0 allows you to send messages of unlimited length over the addon comm channels.
It'll automatically split the messages into multiple parts and rebuild them on the receiving end.
ChatThrottleLib is of course being used to avoid being disconnected by the server.

AceComm-3.0 can be embeded into your addon, either explicitly by calling `AceComm:Embed(MyAddon)` or by specifying it as an embeded library in your AceAddon. All functions will be available on your addon object and can be accessed directly, without having to explicitly call AceComm itself.
It is recommended to embed AceComm, otherwise you'll have to specify a custom `self` on all calls you make into AceComm.
