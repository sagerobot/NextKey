# AceEvent-3.0

AceEvent-3.0 provides event registration and secure dispatching.
All dispatching is done using CallbackHandler-1.0. AceEvent is a simple wrapper around CallbackHandler, and dispatches all game events or addon message to the registrees.

AceEvent-3.0 can be embeded into your addon, either explicitly by calling `AceEvent:Embed(MyAddon)` or by specifying it as an embeded library in your AceAddon. All functions will be available on your addon object and can be accessed directly, without having to explicitly call AceEvent itself.
It is recommended to embed AceEvent, otherwise you'll have to specify a custom `self` on all calls you make into AceEvent.

## AceEvent:RegisterEvent(event[, callback [, arg]])
